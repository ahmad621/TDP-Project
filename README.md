# TDP-Project
* How I expected the challenge to go. 

I was confident with HTML & CSS but I expected it to be a challenge due to my limited experience with Javascript.
but it was a challenge for me, how to do functionality in javascript.
However, through errors made I was able to learn.

* What went well?

I was able to break down the task into smaller chunks of problems and be able to tackle them which made the project easier to complete.
Moreover, working with someone else who had more experience with JS was extremely helpful, as he was able to explain concepts to me and methods available in javascript.

* What didn't go as planned?

The filtering functionality was difficult for me to implement, but with help, it was eventually achieved.
The delete & edit functionality was difficult for me to implement, but it was eventually achieved.

* Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. 
  I learn from this project practice is more important but sometime we need to read properly, e.g how this
  functionality works which is make project easy.
